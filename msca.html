Invitation to a Postdoctoral Fellowship Application at the University of Vienna

The Natural Language Processing Lab [1] at the Data Mining and Machine Learning Research Group, University of Vienna, invites researchers (who have or will have a PhD degree at the call deadline in September 2023 and fulfill the eligibility criteria) to prepare a joint application for an EU-funded Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellowship [2,3].

Potential topics can be in current areas of NLP research, e.g.:
- Measuring and improving interpretability, fairness, robustness in large language models  
- Privacy-preserving learning with language data 
- Using additional knowledge sources for information extraction from text
- Reasoning with knowledge graphs and language

Potential candidates should have published at top NLP or ML conferences (EMNLP,ACL,NAACL,NeurIPS,ICML,ICLR).

In case of agreement on a Fellowship application, the NLP lab will support the candidate in the preparation, including a fully funded research visit at the University of Vienna (if desired).

If you want to learn more, please send an email to Benjamin Roth (benjamin.roth@univie.ac.at) with your CV attached and the subject line "msca ml nlp".
